# Hi, I'm Mitch 👋

I’m a Systems Administrator and IT consultant based in Utah. I help people make sense of their technology—whether that’s building out a secure network, streamlining onboarding, or just making sure the Wi-Fi doesn’t drop during your Monday meeting.

My goal is simple: make IT feel personal and genuinely helpful. No jargon, no runaround—just reliable solutions that support the way you actually work.

Take a look around, and if you like what you see, let’s chat.
