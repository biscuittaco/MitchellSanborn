# About Me

Hey, I’m Mitch — a Systems Administrator and IT consultant based in Utah. I work at WebGuy Internet, where we help small businesses make sense of their tech without making it more complicated than it needs to be.

Most of my time is spent designing, fixing, or improving networks and systems that people rely on every day. I’ve built secure, PCI-compliant networks, set up multi-site VPNs, and deployed infrastructure that just works—without getting in anyone’s way. I’m comfortable across Windows, macOS, and Linux, and I have a particular fondness for the clean, well-integrated approach of Apple environments.

I believe in keeping things simple, clean, and human-centered. I’m constantly refining workflows, improving onboarding experiences, and cutting out the clutter—whether that's in the infrastructure or the process. I use tools like Jamf, Proxmox, and Docker, and I automate wherever it makes sense using PowerShell, and Bash.

Outside of work, I’m a new dad, gear tinkerer, and slowly winning the war on household clutter. Life's full, but it’s good.

At the end of the day, I don’t just care about the tech—I care about the people using it. My goal is always to make IT feel personal and helpful, and to create systems that support people’s workflows instead of slowing them down. If it makes life easier, that’s a win in my book.
