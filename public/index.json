I work at WebGuy Internet, where we help small businesses make sense of their tech without making it more complicated than it needs to be.\nMost of my time is spent designing, fixing, or improving networks and systems that people rely on every day. I‚Äôve built secure, PCI-compliant networks, set up multi-site VPNs, and deployed infrastructure that just works‚Äîwithout getting in anyone‚Äôs way. I‚Äôm comfortable across Windows, macOS, and Linux, and I have a particular fondness for the clean, well-integrated approach of Apple environments.\nI believe in keeping things simple, clean, and human-centered. I‚Äôm constantly refining workflows, improving onboarding experiences, and cutting out the clutter‚Äîwhether that\u0026rsquo;s in the infrastructure or the process. I use tools like Jamf, Proxmox, and Docker, and I automate wherever it makes sense using PowerShell, and Bash.\nOutside of work, I‚Äôm a new dad, gear tinkerer, and slowly winning the war on household clutter. Life\u0026rsquo;s full, but it‚Äôs good.\nAt the end of the day, I don‚Äôt just care about the tech‚ÄîI care about the people using it. My goal is always to make IT feel personal and helpful, and to create systems that support people‚Äôs workflows instead of slowing them down. If it makes life easier, that‚Äôs a win in my book.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Homelab # Welcome to the Sanborn Homelab ‚Äî part testing ground, part personal infrastructure, and part proving ground for projects I might roll out to clients. It‚Äôs where I experiment, break things on purpose, and keep the gears turning at home.\nHardware # The lab is currently spread across three primary systems:\nCustom-built PC with a Ryzen 7 3700x and 32GB of RAM ‚Äî used for lightweight workloads and Docker containers. Dual-node Supermicro SYS-2028TP-DC1R ‚Äî each node runs dual Xeon E5-2643 v4 CPUs and 128GB of RAM. This is where most of the heavy lifting happens. TrueNAS server for storage, served over NFS and used as a Proxmox Backup target among other things. Networking # The network is managed through a UniFi Dream Machine Pro. Everything is segmented with VLANs for isolation and clarity. I use:\nSite Magic to maintain a VPN tunnel between my house and my parents‚Äô for remote connectivity. WireGuard for secure remote access when I‚Äôm away from home. Pi-hole (primary + secondary) for local DNS and ad-blocking. Active Directory to test domain join scenarios and group policy application. Services # Here are just a few of the services currently running across the lab:\nAuth: authentik, AD, Vaultwarden Network: nginx-proxy-manager, uptime-kuma Productivity: paperless-ngx, actualbudget, hoarder Media: mealie, immich Automation: homeassistant, homebridge Dev: gitlab, SanbornDC, docker Management: proxmox, pbs (Proxmox Backup Server), TrueNAS, homepage, pelican-panel üìà Check uptime status ‚Äì Live view of my self-hosted services Everything‚Äôs containerized where possible, with Docker and Compose managing a good chunk of the orchestration.\nGoals # The lab doesn‚Äôt follow a strict philosophy‚Äîjust solid performance to support testing, learning, and real-world reliability. Right now, I‚Äôm working on integrating authentik across most services and tying it to my Active Directory for centralized identity via LDAP.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s always evolving, and that‚Äôs the fun part.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/homelab/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" My Resume # üìÑ Download Resume\nOff-Resume Things # There‚Äôs only so much you can cram into a single page of a resume. This is where I keep the rest ‚Äî the stories, philosophies, and hands-on wins that reflect how I actually work, not just what tools I‚Äôve used.\nüß† How I Think About IT # IT should be personal. I believe users deserve support that feels human. That means listening, tailoring solutions, and not hiding behind tickets or buzzwords. Documentation is part of the deliverable. I write things down ‚Äî clearly and with context. Good documentation keeps systems resilient and makes handoffs smoother for everyone involved. Simple beats clever. I‚Äôd rather deploy something stable and well-supported than something overly complex that only I can fix. Test first, then deploy. My homelab exists to break things safely before they hit production. It‚Äôs saved me (and clients) from disaster more than once. Respect the user\u0026rsquo;s workflow. Every environment is different. My goal is to enhance how people work, not force them into new habits just to fit a system. üõ†Ô∏è Projects I Couldn‚Äôt Fit on My Resume # AD + DNS rebuild with zero downtime: Took aging, unreliable domain infrastructure and rebuilt it using Proxmox on repurposed hardware. I deployed a clean Windows Server instance in our Salt Lake office, migrated roles and services, and established replication with the Murray site ‚Äî all without end-user disruption. Bonus: cleaned up outdated policies and simplified DNS zones in the process. Brewery PCI network design: Created a secure, segmented network for a local brewery including POS isolation, guest Wi-Fi, camera VLANs, and a secure site-to-site VPN. The project involved replacing unmanaged legacy hardware with modern, VLAN-capable gear and ensuring the final design passed a third-party PCI audit. Onboarding, without the tickets: Replaced a jumbled onboarding process with a straightforward workflow that relies on real communication instead of automated ticket queues. The result: consistent device setup, smoother user transitions, and less back-and-forth with HR. Self-hosted playground: My homelab runs over 30 services ‚Äî everything from file servers to security tools ‚Äî mimicking client environments so I can test updates, configuration changes, and integrations with zero risk. üîç Things I‚Äôm Digging Into # SSO via Authentik + Active Directory: I‚Äôm mid-way through rolling out Authentik across my services with LDAP integration to centralize login management and eventually bring this to clients who need better identity control. Onboarding automation: Writing PowerShell and Bash scripts that make user setup, permissions, and device configuration less of a chore and more of a one-click process. Proxmox + TrueNAS workflows: Working on making the two coexist more elegantly for lab backups and shared storage across VMs and containers. ‚öôÔ∏è Tools I Really Like # Proxmox ‚Äì My go-to for virtualization. Stable, flexible, and friendly to older hardware. Jamf + Mosyle ‚Äì Essential for managing Apple devices the right way, especially in BYOD and education settings. Docker + Compose ‚Äì Lightweight service deployment that‚Äôs perfect for both homelab tinkering and real client use cases. UniFi gear ‚Äì Easy to manage and VLAN-friendly, with just enough nerd knobs to keep things interesting. Markdown + Wiki.js ‚Äì Clear, fast, and maintainable documentation is half the battle in IT. ü§ì Fun (Or Painful) Quirks # I color-code patch cables for aesthetic and sanity. I still use OneNote for time tracking ‚Äî not because it\u0026rsquo;s perfect, but because it creates clear accountability for clients. It shows what I did, how long it took, and leaves a trail of notes for the next tech to understand how things were set up. My homelab\u0026rsquo;s uptime has outperformed some production networks I‚Äôve inherited (not naming names).
