I work at WebGuy Internet, where we help small businesses make sense of their tech without making it more complicated than it needs to be.\nMost of my time is spent designing, fixing, or improving networks and systems that people rely on every day. Iâ€™ve built secure, PCI-compliant networks, set up multi-site VPNs, and deployed infrastructure that just worksâ€”without getting in anyoneâ€™s way. Iâ€™m comfortable across Windows, macOS, and Linux, and I have a particular fondness for the clean, well-integrated approach of Apple environments.\nI believe in keeping things simple, clean, and human-centered. Iâ€™m constantly refining workflows, improving onboarding experiences, and cutting out the clutterâ€”whether that\u0026rsquo;s in the infrastructure or the process. I use tools like Jamf, Proxmox, and Docker, and I automate wherever it makes sense using PowerShell, and Bash.\nOutside of work, Iâ€™m a new dad, gear tinkerer, and slowly winning the war on household clutter. Life\u0026rsquo;s full, but itâ€™s good.\nAt the end of the day, I donâ€™t just care about the techâ€”I care about the people using it. My goal is always to make IT feel personal and helpful, and to create systems that support peopleâ€™s workflows instead of slowing them down. If it makes life easier, thatâ€™s a win in my book.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Homelab # Welcome to the Sanborn Homelab â€” part testing ground, part personal infrastructure, and part proving ground for projects I might roll out to clients. Itâ€™s where I experiment, break things on purpose, and keep the gears turning at home.\nHardware # The lab is currently spread across three primary systems:\nCustom-built PC with a Ryzen 7 3700x and 32GB of RAM â€” used for lightweight workloads and Docker containers. Dual-node Supermicro SYS-2028TP-DC1R â€” each node runs dual Xeon E5-2643 v4 CPUs and 128GB of RAM. This is where most of the heavy lifting happens. TrueNAS server for storage, served over NFS and used as a Proxmox Backup target among other things. Networking # The network is managed through a UniFi Dream Machine Pro. Everything is segmented with VLANs for isolation and clarity. I use:\nSite Magic to maintain a VPN tunnel between my house and my parentsâ€™ for remote connectivity. WireGuard for secure remote access when Iâ€™m away from home. Pi-hole (primary + secondary) for local DNS and ad-blocking. Active Directory to test domain join scenarios and group policy application. Services # Here are just a few of the services currently running across the lab:\nAuth: authentik, AD, Vaultwarden Network: nginx-proxy-manager, uptime-kuma Productivity: paperless-ngx, actualbudget, hoarder Media: mealie, immich Automation: homeassistant, homebridge Dev: gitlab, SanbornDC, docker Management: proxmox, pbs (Proxmox Backup Server), TrueNAS, homepage, pelican-panel Everythingâ€™s containerized where possible, with Docker and Compose managing a good chunk of the orchestration.\nAutomation \u0026amp; Backups # Iâ€™ve used resources like Helper-Scripts.com, but much of the setup has been done manually to better understand the ins and outs. Proxmox handles backups with its native backup server, writing to TrueNAS over NFS.\nGoals # The lab doesnâ€™t follow a strict philosophyâ€”just solid performance to support testing, learning, and real-world reliability. Right now, Iâ€™m working on integrating authentik across most services and tying it to my Active Directory for centralized identity via LDAP.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s always evolving, and thatâ€™s the fun part.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/homelab/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":" Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Mitch ðŸ‘‹ # Iâ€™m a Systems Administrator and IT consultant based in Utah.
